    <!-- HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol -->
    <!-- URL: is the human version of the protocol to access a resource. Universal Resource Locator -->
    <!-- DNS: Turns a hostname into an IP address readable by the computer -->
    <!-- Query String: A Query String changes the URL to find a specific portion of the resource -->
    <!-- HTTP verbs: Two verbs are Get and Post. Get requests without side affects, whereas Post requests with side affects. -->
    <!-- HTTP request: A request is a computer searching for a particular page/resource -->
    <!-- HTTP response: Is what the computer returns from a HTTP request -->
    <!-- HTTP Header: Names/Values that help transfer data -->
    <!-- Process: Once the URL is entered, the DNS first searches local networks for the accompanying IP address. If not found, the DNS searches the outer networks. Once the IP address is found, the DNS accesses the resource from a port, defined by the protocol chosen. Once the data is accessed, the website responds in a similar matter, updating the response status. -->
